- merge config of parts into a unified config dialog
- same for unified credits
- find a solution for a setup wizard
- replace Splash class with QSplashScreen
- make the "new" action a bit smarter, involves changes in KActionMenu
- move plugins to respective apps for code sharing(?)
- Summary (what's next) view (slueppken)
- Basic groupware functionality (Exchange 2k and Kolab)
- make the headerWidget look nicer (we might use KIconLoader
  for larger icons) (slueppken)
